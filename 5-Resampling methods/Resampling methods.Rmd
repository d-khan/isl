Resampling methods involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training set and refitting the same statistical method multiple times using different subsets of the training data. There are two most commonly used resampling methods, *cross-valdiation* and *bootstrap*. **Cross-validation** can be used to estimate the test error associated with a given statistical learning method in order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model's performance is known as *model assessment*. The process of selecting the proper level of flexibility for a model is known as *model selection*. The **bootstrap** is used to measure accuracy of a parameter estimate of a given statistical learning method.
